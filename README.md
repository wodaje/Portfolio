# Portfolio Informational Interface

## Description 
This serves to promote myself (Jeff Woda) by displaying:

1. Portfolio of Projects

2. Contact Information with links to:
	
	a) Resume
	b) Git Hub
	c) LinkedIn

3. As well as the lottery generator game designed to allow for further random generation to my informational links. 

_(Future development on this issue is to change the auto-forward page feature to an optional Modal to make the point but not the transition for more user friendly approach)_
